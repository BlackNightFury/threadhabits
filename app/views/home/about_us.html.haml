              FAQ
            %strong What is Threadhabits?
            %p Founded in 2017, Threadhabits is a peer to peer clothing distribution marketplace that focuses on quality control, authentic goods, and affordable pricing. Wether you’re looking to purchase new clothing or sell clothing you’re ready to get rid of, this is the place to do it.

            %strong How does it work?
            %p Sellers list their items on our platform, and they’re automatically published as inventory on our website.

            %strong What are your fees?
            %p One of the many things that makes Threadhabits so great is that it’s free for both buyers and sellers. Threadhabits charges 0% commission unlike other marketplaces that charge 9%-25%. However, PayPal does charge a 2.5% fee when you receive a payment. We are unable to do anything about PayPal fees.

            %strong How do I contact Threadhabits?
            %p Our customer service is 24/7. You can send us an email at quinn@threadhabits.com, use our contact form, or call us at +1 8642023107

            %strong Do you accept PayPal?
            %p All sellers on Threadhabits are required to have a PayPal account to list items on our platform. Any seller on our account accepts PayPal.

            %strong Why isn’t my payment going through?
            %p Although there are many reasons that your payment could be declined, a few examples could be your card information being incorrect, having an insufficient PayPal balance, or your bank declining your payment. Our payment processor is PayPal, so it may be beneficial to take a look at their reasons as to why your payment could be declined.

            %strong Are your items authentic?
            %p Unlike a lot of marketplaces, we pay incredible attention to quality control on our site. We look at each listing individually to make sure that the listing images are high-quality, the product is described correctly, the user is qualified to sell on our platform, and the item is authentic. If you receive an item that you believe was not described correctly or isn’t authentic, you are protected by Threadhabits and by PayPal’s buyer seller protection that insures money back guaranteed.

            %strong Do you accept returns?
            %p The ability to return an item varies and is dependent on each individual seller on our platform. If you want to know if a seller accepts returns on the item they are selling, we recommend that you contact the seller directly. If an item received is damaged or not as described, you are protected by our protection policy as well as PayPal’s.

            %strong How much does shipping cost?
            %p Similar to returns, shipping costs are also dependent on the sellers on our platform. Shipping costs are determined by each individual seller and may vary based on location.
